# Changelog

## [1.3.0]

-   feat: You can now unshare notes before they expire from the server.
-   feat: Quickshare now has a sidebar panel to visually see your recently shared notes.

## [1.2.0]

-   feat: the plugin now shares the note's name as title (like Obsidian's "show inline title" option in the appearance settings). This behavior can be disabled in the plugin's settings.

## [1.1.1]

-   improvement: frontmatter URL is now wrapped in quotation marks to escape YAML formatting.
-   improvement: frontmatter can be turned off in the settings
-   improvement: frontmatter date format can be set in settings

## [1.1.0]

-   feat: After sharing a note, the URL is now stored in the note's frontmatter, along with the time it was shared.

## [1.0.2]

-   security: upgraded encryption schema to use a GCM cipher.
-   security: quickshare now generates a random initialization vector instead of using a zero-vector to prevent [theoretical known-plaintext attacks](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare/issues/21).

## [1.0.1]

-   security: changed key generation implementation to mitigate content verification attack (see https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare/issues/20 to learn more).

## [1.0.0]

Obsidian QuickShare and Noteshare.space are now out of beta üöÄ You can now find the plugin
in the Obsidian community plugin marketplace (see [instructions](https://noteshare.space/install)).
Check out the roadmap for upcoming features [here](https://noteshare.space/roadmap).

This release is further identical to version 0.4.1.

## [0.4.0]

-   feat: New notes are now encrypted using the SubtleCrypto web standard for better security and performance.

## [0.3.0]

-   The plugin now sends an anonymous user id and your plugin version to server. This will be used to track broad usage service utility trends (e.g. active users/week) and apply fair use limits per user. The user id is generated using a random number generator and reveals no identifiable information about the user.

## [0.2.0]

-   Rebranded the plugin to QuickShare. I believe this better encapsulates what the plugin does, and is easier to say.

## [0.1.1]

-   bug: üêõ Fix the server URL not resetting to `https://noteshare.space` when enabling the "Use Noteshare.space" option in the plugin settings.

## [0.1.0]

### First version!

-   Added command: "Create share link"
-   Added item to Options menu on Markdown panes: "Create share link"
-   Default note storage provider is set to [Noteshare.space](https://noteshare.space)
-   Storage provider can be changed for users who want to host their own instance
